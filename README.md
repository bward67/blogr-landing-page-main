# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Blogr landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP).

I loved this challenge. With each challenge I learn more and this time I learned how important it is to give all the images a really good look BEFORE coding the HTML. At first glance I thought picture - source was the way to go with all the images - then once I started the css I noticed that some images needed cropping and enlarging so then I had to change them to background-images. This wasted a lot of my time and made my code very messy. BUT I HAVE LEARNED for next time :).

The dropdown menus were fun to do. So much fun that I added a few things in JS - like: close any opened menus before you open a new one and rotate the down-arrow to make it into an up-arrow. However, this isn't working in the mobile view. I think it is something to do with the hamburger menu. I will research this.

The linear gradients gave me trouble so I used background-colors instead. This is something that I will research as well. However, it did force me to get a lot of practice with background-images.
